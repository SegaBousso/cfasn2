Tab(text: 'Tous ($totalCount)'),
Tab(text: 'Actifs ($activeCount)'),
Tab(text: 'Vérifiés ($verifiedCount)'),
Tab(text: 'Disponibles ($availableCount)'),
```

**Bulk Operations:**
```dart
// Multi-selection support with confirmation
onBulkDelete: () async {
  final confirmed = await showBulkDeleteConfirmation(context, count);
  if (confirmed) await bulkDeleteProviders(selectedIds);
}
```

**Event Flow:**
```dart
// Tab change -> Filter update -> Data refresh -> UI update
handleTabChanged() -> FilterEvent -> applyFilters() -> setState()

// Provider action -> Event emission -> API call -> Success notification
handleToggleStatus() -> ToggleStatusEvent -> toggleProviderStatus() -> StatusToggledEvent

// Bulk operation -> Confirmation -> Event emission -> API call -> Selection clear
handleBulkDelete() -> showConfirmation() -> BulkDeleteEvent -> bulkDelete() -> clearSelection()
```

This refactoring transforms a complex admin screen into a maintainable, scalable solution with excellent user experience and developer-friendly architecture.

## Architecture Patterns

### Handler Structure
Each screen follows this handler pattern:
1. **Data Handler**: Manages data state and models
2. **Events**: Defines EventBus event types
3. **Data Handler**: Handles API calls and data loading
4. **Filter Handler**: Manages filtering and search logic
5. **Action Handler**: Handles user actions (save, delete, etc.)
6. **Event Handler**: Coordinates all handlers and manages EventBus

### Widget Structure
Modular widgets follow these principles:
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each widget has one clear purpose
2. **Parameterized**: Configurable through constructor parameters
3. **Stateless**: No internal state management
4. **Reusable**: Can be used in different contexts

### EventBus Integration
All async operations use EventBus for communication:
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Data updates
- User actions
- Navigation events

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Continue Screen Refactoring
- User profile screens (profile editing, settings)
- Search and filter screens
- Payment and checkout flows
- Additional admin management screens

### Priority 2: Enhanced Architecture
- Add unit tests for handlers and widgets
- Implement integration tests for complex flows
- Add performance monitoring for EventBus communication
- Consider adding state persistence for better UX

### Priority 3: Code Quality
- Address remaining lint warnings (deprecated methods, unused imports)
- Optimize Firestore caching strategies
- Add more comprehensive error handling
- Improve documentation for complex widgets

## Current Status
- **8 major screens** successfully refactored using Clean Architecture
- **All critical bugs fixed** (service selection, image upload, hero tags)
- **Debug code cleaned up** for production readiness
- **Strong foundation** established for future refactoring work
- **Consistent patterns** implemented across all refactored screens

The codebase now follows a consistent Clean Architecture pattern with:
- ✅ Separated business logic (handlers)
- ✅ Modular UI components (widgets)
- ✅ Event-driven communication (EventBus)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Production-ready code quality

## Technical Implementation Details

### EventBus Configuration
```dart
// Singleton EventBus instance used throughout the app
final eventBus = EventBus.instance;

// Event emission
eventBus.emit(BookingsLoadedEvent(bookings));

// Event listening
eventBus.on<BookingsLoadedEvent>().listen((event) {
  // Handle event
});
```

### Handler Integration
```dart
// Screen initialization
_data = MyBookingsData();
_eventHandler = MyBookingsEventHandler(
  context: context,
  data: _data,
  onStateChanged: () => setState(() {}),
);

// Handler coordination
_eventHandler.initialize(); // Sets up all sub-handlers
```

### Widget Composition
```dart
// Modular widget usage
BookingListView(
  bookings: data.filteredBookings,
  onRefresh: eventHandler.handleRefresh,
  onBookingTap: eventHandler.handleBookingTap,
)
```

## Bug Fixes & Optimizations

### 1. Debug Logs Cleanup ✅
**Date:** January 2025

**Issues Fixed:**
- Removed all temporary debug print statements from ProviderServicesSelection widget
- Removed debug button that was used for troubleshooting service selection
- Cleaned up debug logs from ProviderServicesHandler 
- Removed emoji-based debug logs (🔄, ✅, ⚠️, etc.) added during debugging

**Files Cleaned:**
- `lib/screens/admin/providers/widgets/provider_services_selection.dart`
- `lib/screens/admin/providers/logic/provider_services_handler.dart`

**Impact:**
- Cleaner console output in production
- Reduced bundle size by removing debug strings
- Better performance without debug logging overhead
- Maintainable codebase without temporary debugging artifacts

### 2. Image Selection Fix ✅
**Date:** January 2025

**Issue:** `type 'XFile' is not a subtype of type 'File'` error in ProviderImageSection

**Solution:**
- Added proper import for `dart:io`
- Fixed `_getImageProvider()` method to convert `XFile.path` to `File`
- Changed from `FileImage(selectedImage as dynamic)` to `FileImage(File(selectedImage!.path))`

**Files Fixed:**
- `lib/screens/admin/providers/widgets/provider_image_section.dart`

### 3. Service Selection Fix ✅
**Date:** January 2025

**Issue:** Services not loading in AddEditProviderScreen due to Firestore cache type conflicts

**Root Cause:** 
- Firestore cache returned `List<_JsonQueryDocumentSnapshot>` instead of `List<ServiceModel>`
- Type cast error when trying to access `ServiceModel` properties

**Solution:**
- Added bypass cache option in `AdminServiceManager.activeServices`
- Implemented fallback mechanism in `ProviderServicesHandler`
- Added proper type checking and error handling

**Files Fixed:**
- `lib/screens/admin/services/services/admin_service_manager.dart`
- `lib/screens/admin/providers/logic/provider_services_handler.dart`

### 4. FloatingActionButton Hero Tag Fix ✅
**Date:** January 2025

**Issue:** "Multiple heroes that share the same tag" error

**Solution:**
- Added unique `heroTag` property to all FloatingActionButton widgets
- Used descriptive tags like 'add-provider', 'add-service', etc.

**Files Fixed:**
- Multiple admin and user screens with FAB widgets
